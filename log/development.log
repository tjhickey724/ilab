Registered users will also be allowed to volunteer their time or other\n\tresources to this project should it go ahead. The IdeaLab team will select new projects to take on by reviewing the\n\tsubmitted projects and comments and matching the skills and interests of each particular development team with the\n\tmost appropriate project. Most projects should be designed to be completed in one semester. Larger projects can be\n\tdecomposed into smaller projects to make this happen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe goal of the IdeaLab is to provide students with a exciting opportunity to solve problems that have a substantial\n\timpact on the community by applying their academic skills and knowledge and by learning how to work in a small, agile\n\tdevelopment team using the latest web and mobile technology.  The projects will be selected to best advance the\n\teducational mission of deepening our students understanding of Computer Science while also having maximum long-term\n\timpact on the community and, ideally, the world.\n\t</p>\n\n<p>Please see <a href=\"index.html\">the opportunities page</a> for examples of previously submitted IdeaLab opportunities.\n\t</p>\n\t<hr/>\n\n"
