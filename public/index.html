<h2>Learning by Making Change</h2>
<img src="images/socialMarket2.jpg" style="width:15%; float:right"/>
<p>
The Idea Lab at Brandeis (ILaB) is a new pedagogical effort in which Computer Science 
students will learn to make positive change in the world by
applying the knowledge and skills they have developed in their academic
classes. Students will sign up for internships or independent studies and will be mentored
by faculty in how to work collaboratively to solve community problems using CS techniques.
</p>

<h2>

Community Generated Projects
</h2>
<p>
The ILaB will solicit and evaluate projects from the community using a socially networked website allowing members of the community to comment on the potential impacts of successful projects as well as to volunteer their time and skills to particular projects.
</p>

<h2>
  Collaborative Faculty/Student/Staff  Development Teams
</h2>
<p>
The idea lab would put together teams of students mentored by faculty and advised by staff
to select and tackle the most high impact community projects which are feasible for that team.
</p>
<h2>
High Impact Projects
</h2>
<p>

The ILaB will aim to select projects that have high impact in the world but that can also be completed and evaluated within one or two semesters.
</p>

<h3>Initial project: the ILaB Project page</h3>
<p>
The first project will be to create the social networking site that will allow members
of the Brandeis community to propose projects and to view  projects proposed by others,
potentially adding comments or volunteering to participate in some capacity.
</p>

<h3>One possible project: the Comprehensive Academic Planner (CAP)</h3> 
<img src="cap.png" style="float:left; width:25%"/>

<p>
Academic planning several years in advance is a long standing problem in Universities
for students, faculty, and adminstrators alike. 
This project would address these problems by building 
a system that would allow departments to easily enter 
and update their tentative 3 year academic plans and allow students to use those plans to
develop 4 year academic schedules could greatly improve the ability of students to plan
their Brandeis careers as well as helping departments estimate the demand for courses 
several years in the future. Such a project would require collaboration with LTS, but the
goal would be to have ILaB assume responsibility for building, developing, maintaining, and
disseminating the project.  
</p>
<p>

The information collected by the CAP project could be leveraged to increase 
the effectiveness of academic planning in a number of ways (including allowing students
to create, share, and comment on named clusters of courses to help other students see
the curriculum in new ways and enhance their college experience). Amazon style recommender
systems could also be created to help students select courses.
If successful, such a system could be useful at other Universities
and would help, in a small way, 
to improve the quality of the  higher education experience world-wide.
